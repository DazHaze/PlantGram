# Wlecome to Planda!
Planda is a growing community of plant enthusiasts that love to share their house plants. 
Share all the plants you are proud of and talk to people about their plants by interacting on their posts. 
Like the plants you see ? Then like them!

This was created for a project for the Full Stack Development course hosted by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/5-day-coding-challenge/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=CI+-+IRL+-+Search+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=14304747355&hsa_grp=128775288209&hsa_ad=539453915484&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-319867646331&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzORRe5o1VJJG9_EwnX2Oxn-ftPjCcE-f8G-M0uOoLartu-8DkXRH5YaAozNEALw_wcB).

## The Website

This Website is created as a base for a fully functioning website.

* This goal of the website from the beginning was to create a solid platform to move forward with. The basic layout is solid and clear which will make it easy to be improved and added to.

* The user can show off the plants that they are proud of and like other plants posted by people.
## Features

### **Existing Features**

* Landing Page

![Landing Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DazHaze/PlantGram/main/media/Landing-page.png)

The landing page is kept simple while still bringing in common design elements that are seen throughout the website. The user can either login in or register if they do not have an account. Page is responsive using bootstrap and has been tested on many devices.

![List View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DazHaze/PlantGram/main/media/list_view.png)

In the image above the main "timeline" of the website can be seen. This is where the user can view and interact with posts. If the user likes a post in this view, or selects "Leave a comment" then they are taken to a view where only that post is visible and a text inpput to leave a comment is visible. This is called the "Post Detail" view which is seen in the image below.

### **Future Features**

* Plants are catagorised based on the users chosen catagories.
* Post funcionality will accept multiple plant images.
* Users can follow other users, showing their posts first on post list view.
* Users can start discussions about plants.

## Deployment
This project was deployed using Heroku. During deployment Heroku had a [security breach](https://blog.heroku.com/github-integration-update) where an attacker gained access to OAuth tokens for heroku - github integration. This meant that this project, while still on Github, was also migrated to Git to be deployed using Heroku. A credit to the Heroku team for showing how to easily do this process while they work on getting the Github integration back up and running. - 20/05/2022
